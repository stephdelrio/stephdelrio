											<h1 class="section-margin title-size"><center>Beginnings</center></h1>
											<p>The team was Tatum Rehorn, Amelia Ruslim and myself. We already had a great dynamic, but we quickly realized our strengths complemented each others.

											Tatum had a graphic design background so she owned the high fidelity wireframes and prototyping. Amelia had a fashion background and was great at covering all the bases; and I had extensive research experience from my political science degree and fashion background, so I took the lead on research and strategy. I had a blast contributing to the other areas of the process as well (design studio sketching, usability testing and reiterating). Our team's emphasis on communication and cross-functional collaboration is what made this project not only successful, but fun. But I’m not going to jump ahead! Keep reading for the rest of the story. </p>

											<p>Our prompt was to explore a problem/area of opportunity for an existing brand. We got to choose the industry, brand, and problem. Fashion was our team’s most common interest, so we immediately started brainstorming, hypothesizing, and researching.</p>
											<p>Among the ideas we initially considered were:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Service design app for Macy’s</li>
												<li>An item finder app for H&amp;M stores</li>
												<li>A virtual try-on feature for Warby Parker</li>
												<li>A shop feature on Pinterest (which we almost submitted a proposal for before finding out that Pinterest had just recently launched it on iOS.)
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>No matter the idea, the problem, or the brand we considered,<b> all of our brainstorming and preliminary research pointed us to the following hypothesis:</b></p>
											<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle">
												 Users have a difficult time finding what they’re looking for.
											</blockquote>
											<p>Amelia mentioned image recognition technology, so we were very interested in how that could solve this problem. But we first needed to research, analyze and validate that it was a problem. So that’s what we did.
											</p>
									
											<p>
												We chose ShopStyle as our brand, because they have a powerful search engine with access to over 12 million products from stores and brands across the web. If any brand could use image recognition on their app to solve the pain point of searching for fashion items, it was ShopStyle.</p>

											<h1 class="section-margin title-size"><center>User Research</center></h1>
											<p>The research phase is one of my favorite parts, because you get to play detective and discover user needs, behaviors, and motivations; but one thing about it is for sure, it is not a linear process. It’s sort of all going on at once. 
											</p>

											<p>Our timeline was a very short two weeks, so we immediately sent out a survey to not only gain quantitative data but to recruit interview participants.</p>
											<p>Our survey data got us off to a great start. We had 98 total respondents with <b>59.2% stating "Finding what I'm looking for" as a central frustration in online shopping.</b> Another data point was how low ShopStyle ranked among its competitors which revealed a business opportunity.</p>

											<br><br>
										
											<p>Out of the 98 survey respondents, we were able to <b>interview 7 participants.</b>We needed to make sure we made the most out of the time given to us, so we planned a discussion guide shown below with the open ended questions we were hoping to get answers to. After each interview, we debriefed as a team, and once we were done with all of our interviews, we synthesized our interview data using an affinity map.</p>

										<p><b>
										Interview Quotes:</b></p>

										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">"I hate searching, because it's only accurate if I type the keywords 100% correctly."
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">
										"I don't always know the words to describe the item I want to find. Sometimes when I try to look up something like winter work attire, the results are completely different from what I was expecting."
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">
										"I'm not always sure which categories to use... is the jacket I'm looking for considered a 'Jacket' or 'Outerwear?'"
										</blockquote>
										</p>
										<p>Our user pain point was validated. Simultaneous to our user research, I was taking a deeper look into image recognition technology.
										According to Market and Markets, the <b>image recognition market worth is estimaged to grow from $9.65 billion in 2014 to $25.65 billion by 2019.</b></p>

										<h1><center>Platform Implementation: <br>iOS Native App</center></h1>
										<p>Our research led us to a mobile solution, specifically for ShopStyle's iOS native app. </p>
										<p><b>Here a few points that led us to focus on mobile:</b></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Mobile commerce is exited to grow at a double-digit compound annual rate between 2015 and 2020 to as much as <a href="http://wwd.com/media-news/digital/facebook-to-test-shopping-section-10259838/" target="_blank">$252 billion.</a></li>
											<li>Based on our survey results, millennials are the central user demographic range for online shopping. </li>
											<li>60% of millennials say that it is convenient to use a smartphone to research or purchase a product on the go.</li>
											<li>More than 50% use their smartphones to research products while shopping.</li>

											<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ios-versus-android-thanksgiving-shopping-2014-11" target="_blank">According to IBM</a>, online shopping on Thanksgving day was up 14.3% versus the year before. Over half (52.1%) of traffic to shopping sites came from mobile devices, up 22.4% from last year. And 32.3% of sales were completed on mobile devices, up 25.4% from last year.</li></ul>
											<p><b>Why we focused on iOS:</b></p>
											<ul>
											<li>According to IBM, iOS users spend more than Android users.</li>
											<li>iOS made up 25.2% (over a quarter) of all online sales on Thanksgiving day 2014. Android only accounted for 6.9%.</li></ul>
											<p>Our project was a month before Thanksgiving 2015, but <b>it turned out that iOS was the way to go after all.</b></p>
											<ul>
											<li><a href="http://www.techinsider.io/ios-users-spend-more-than-android-users-2015-12" target="_blank">Nearly 40% of all online traffic the day after Thanksgiving 2015 came from iOS. Only 17.3% came from Android.</a></li>

										<h1 class="section-margin title-size"><center>Competitive Analysis</center></h1>
										<p>While we did our user research, we also conducted competitive analysis. We started off broad considering any app that could be a competitor to ShopStyle’s business model and then narrowed it down to the few that had an image recognition feature which were Craves, Amazon Flow, and Neiman Marcus.</p><br>

												<br><br>
												<p>From our feature analysis, we took a deeper look at Craves, Amazon Flow, and Neiman Marcus. We downloaded and analyzed each of these apps, analyzing the usability, the user flow, the UI, testing the accuracy and breadth of the technology. We took note of what we liked and didn't like and factored that into our design strategy. </p>

										<br>
										<p>The more research we did, the more we realized how much of a business opportunity this was for ShopStyle. Apparently, besides the three competitors we had analyzed, Macy's and Urban outfitters had also recently  signed contracts with providers of image recognition technology. It seemed we were on to something...</p>
										<!-- <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
										<p>There was definitely a market for it. <a href="http://investor.slyce.it/" target="_blank">According to Slyce</a>, 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual, and it’s processed 60,000 times faster than text.</p>
										<p><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/image-recognition.asp" target="_blank">According to Markets &amp; Markets</a>, <em>the image recognition market worth is estimated to grow from $9.65 billion 2014 to $25.65 billion by 2019.</em></p> -->

										<!-- <p><b>Macy’s Success Story</b><br>In 2014, Macy's announced the integration of visual search software within their mobile application. Macy's was later named 2014 Mobile Retailer of the Year, the highest accolade in mobile commerce and retail. http://careers.ulitzer.com/node/3270217#related</p> -->
