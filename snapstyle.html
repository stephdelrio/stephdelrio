                <p>The team was Tatum Rehorn, Amelia Ruslim and myself. We
                already had a great dynamic, but we quickly realized our
                strengths complemented each others. Tatum had a graphic design
                background so she owned the high fidelity wireframes and
                prototyping. Amelia had a fashion background and was great at
                covering all the bases; and I had extensive research experience
                from my political science degree and fashion background, so I
                took the lead on research and strategy. I had a blast
                contributing to the other areas of the process as well (design
                studio sketching, usability testing and reiterating). Our
                team's emphasis on communication and cross-functional
                collaboration is what made this project not only successful,
                but fun. But I’m not going to jump ahead! Keep reading for the
                rest of the story.</p>

                    <p>Our prompt was to explore a problem/area of opportunity
                    for an existing brand. We got to choose the industry,
                    brand, and problem. Fashion was our team’s most common
                    interest, so we immediately started brainstorming,
                    hypothesizing, and researching.</p>
                    <p>Among the ideas we initially considered were:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Service design app for Macy’s</li>
                      <li>An item finder app for H&amp;M stores</li>
                      <li>A virtual try-on feature for Warby Parker</li>
                      <li>A shop feature on Pinterest (which we almost
                      submitted a proposal for before finding out that
                      Pinterest had just recently launched it on iOS.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>No matter the idea, the problem, or the brand we
                    considered, <b>all of our brainstorming and preliminary
                    research pointed us to the following hypothesis:</b></p>
                    <blockquote class="customQuoteStyle">
                      Users have a difficult time finding what they’re looking
                      for.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Amelia mentioned image recognition technology, so we
                    were very interested in how that could solve this problem.
                    But we first needed to research, analyze and validate that
                    it was a problem. So that’s what we did.</p>
                    <p>We chose ShopStyle as our brand, because they have a
                    powerful search engine with access to over 12 million
                    products from stores and brands across the web. If any
                    brand could use image recognition on their app to solve the
                    pain point of searching for fashion items, it was
                    ShopStyle.</p>

                    <p>The research phase is one of my favorite parts, because
                    you get to play detective and discover user needs,
                    behaviors, and motivations; but one thing about it is for
                    sure, it is not a linear process. It’s sort of all going on
                    at once.</p>
                    <p>Our timeline was a very short two weeks, so we
                    immediately sent out a survey to not only gain quantitative
                    data but to recruit interview participants.</p>
                    <p>Our survey data got us off to a great start. We had 98
                    total respondents with <b>59.2% stating "Finding what I'm
                    looking for" as a central frustration in online
                    shopping.</b> Another data point was how low ShopStyle
                    ranked among its competitors which revealed a business
                    opportunity.</p><br>

                    made the most out of the time given to us, so we planned a
                    discussion guide shown below with the open ended questions
                    we were hoping to get answers to. After each interview, we
                    debriefed as a team, and once we were done with all of our
                    interviews, we synthesized our interview data using an
                    affinity map.</p><br>

                      last year.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>According to IBM, iOS users spend more than Android
                      users.</li>
                      <li>iOS made up 25.2% (over a quarter) of all online
                      sales on Thanksgiving day 2014. Android only accounted
                      for 6.9%.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our project was a month before Thanksgiving 2015, but
                    <b>it turned out that iOS was the way to go after
                    all.</b></p>

                    <p>While we did our user research, we also conducted
                    competitive analysis. We started off broad considering any
                    app that could be a competitor to ShopStyle’s business
                    model and then narrowed it down to the few that had an
                    image recognition feature which were Craves, Amazon Flow,
                    and Neiman Marcus.</p><br>

                          downloaded and analyzed each of these apps, analyzing
                          the usability, the user flow, the UI, testing the
                          accuracy and breadth of the technology. We took note
                          of what we liked and didn't like and factored that
                          into our design strategy.</p>

                    of a business opportunity this was for ShopStyle.
                    Apparently, besides the three competitors we had analyzed,
                    Macy's and Urban outfitters had also recently signed
                    contracts with providers of image recognition technology.
                    It seemed we were on to something...</p>
