											<h2>The Brief:</h2>
											<p>This was a student project at General Assembly in which we were given the opportunity to solve a user pain point for an existing brand.</p>

											<h2>Problem:</h2>
											<p>Shoppers can't always identify the right keywords to search for what they are looking for.</p>
											
											<h2>Solution:</h2>
											<p>A visual search feature integration to enable shoppers to search for, discover, and buy anything they can photograph.</p>

											<h2>My role:</h2>
											<p>Lead Researcher, Strategist, Designer, Usability Tester</p>

											<h2>My Team:</h2>
											<p>The team was Tatum Rehorn, Amelia Ruslim and yours truly. We already had a great dynamic as classmates, but we quickly realized our strengths complemented each others and allowed that to help us strive to success.

											Tatum had a graphic design background so she naturally and excellently owned the high fidelity wireframes and prototyping. Amelia had a fashion background and was great at covering all the bases. And I had extensive research experience from my political science degree and fashion background so I took the lead on research and strategy. I had a blast contributing to the other areas of the process as well (design studio sketching, usability testing and reiterating). I truly believe our team's emphasis on communication and cross-functional collaboration is what made this project not only successful, but fun. But I’m not going to jump ahead! Keep reading for the rest of the story. </p>

											<h2 class="section-margin title-size">Our Hypothesis:</h2>
											<p>We identified fashion as our team’s most common interest and immediately started hypothesizing, researching, and brainstorming.</p>
											<ul>
												<b>Among the ideas</b> we initially considered were: <br>
												<li>Service design app for Macy’s</li>
												<li>An item finder app for H&amp;M stores</li>
												<li>A virtual try-on feature for Warby Parker</li>
												<li>A shop feature on Pinterest (which we almost submitted a proposal for before finding out that Pinterest had just recently launched it on iOS. It was back to the drawing board.)
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>All of our brainstorming and preliminary research pointed us to the following hypothesis:</p>
											<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle">
												 Users have a difficult time finding what they’re looking for.
											</blockquote>
											<p>Amelia mentioned image recognition technology, so we were very interested in how that could solve this hypothetical problem. But we first needed to research, analyze and validate. So that’s what we did!
											</p>
											<h2>The Brand:</h2>
											<p>We chose ShopStyle, because they have a powerful search engine with access to over 12 million products from stores and brands across the web. If any brand could use a visual search feature on their app effectively to solve the pain point of searching for fashion items, it was ShopStyle.</p>

											<h1 class="section-margin title-size"><center>Research &amp; Discovery</center></h1>
											<p>The discovery phase is one of my favorite parts, because you get to play detective and find out if your hypothesis is true or not. But one thing about it is for sure, it is not a linear process. It’s sort of all going on at once. 
											</p>

											<h2>User Research: </h2>
											<p>First things first - we needed to find out if our hypothesis was true, so we immediately started drafting up a survey to recruit interview participants.</p>
											<p>Our survey data got us off to a great start:</p>
											<p>We had 98 respondents. Our hypothesis was validated early on with 60% of users surveyed stating "Finding what I'm looking for" as a central fustration in online shopping. We were able to interview 7 participants and synthesized our data using an affinity map.</p>

										<div class="center-images">
											<img src="images/snapstyle/AffinityMapDuo.jpg" alt="affinity">
											<div class="imgCaption">Synthesizing our interview data</div>
										</div>
										<br>
										
										<p>The #1 Pain Point was "Finding What I'm Looking For.
										<br>
										Some quotes from our interviews:

										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">"I hate searching, because it's only accurate if I type the keywords 100% correctly."
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">
										"I don't always know the words to describe the item I want to find. Sometimes when I try to look up something like winter work attire, the results are completely different from what I was expecting."
										</blockquote>
										<blockquote class="customQuoteStyle-2">
										"I'm not always sure which categories to use... is the jacket I'm looking for considered a 'Jacket' or 'Outerwear?'"
										</blockquote>
										</p>

										<h2>User Personas &amp; Scenarios:</h2>
										<p>Personas are fictitious characters created to represent the users goals and behaviors based on synthesized data from user interviews. Personas are helpful in putting a name and face to our users. It helps us remember and empathize for them. </p>

										<h2>Platform Implementation: iOS Native App</h2>
										<p>Our research led us to a mobile solution, specifically for ShopStyle's iOS native app. </p>
										<ul><b>Here a few points that led us to focus on mobile:</b><br>
											<li>Mobile commerce is exited to grow at a double-digit compound annual rate between 2015 and 2020 to as much as <a href="http://wwd.com/media-news/digital/facebook-to-test-shopping-section-10259838/" target="_blank">$252 billion.</a></li>
											<li>Based on our survey results, millennials are the central user demographic range for online shopping. </li>
											<li>60% of millennials say that it is convenient to use a smartphone to research or purchase a product on the go.</li>
											<li>More than 50% use their smartphones to research products while shopping.</li>

											<li><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ios-versus-android-thanksgiving-shopping-2014-11" target="_blank">According to IBM</a>, online shopping on Thanksgving day was up 14.3% versus the year before. Over half (52.1%) of traffic to shopping sites came from mobile devices, up 22.4% from last year. And 32.3% of sales were completed on mobile devices, up 25.4% from last year.</li>
											<p><b>And why we focused on iOS:</b></p>
											<li>According to IBM, iOS users spend more than Android users.</li>
											<li>iOS made up 25.2% (over a quarter) of all online sales on Thanksgiving day 2014. Android only accounted for 6.9%.</li>
											<p>Our project was a month before Thanksgiving 2015, but it turned out that iOS was the way to go after all! Check out these stats:</p>

											<li><a href="http://www.techinsider.io/ios-users-spend-more-than-android-users-2015-12" target="_blank">Nearly 40% of all online traffic the day after Thanksgiving 2015 came from iOS. Only 17.3% came from Android.</a></li>

										<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
										<p>While we did our user research, we also conducted competitive analysis. We started off broad considering any app that could be a competitor to ShopStyle’s business model and then narrowed it down to the few that had an image recognition feature.</p><br>

												</div>
											</header>
										</div><br>
										<p>We were surprised to see a few retailers already tapping into image recognition.</p>
										<p>Neiman Marcus, Macy's, and Urban outfitters had all signed contracts with the lead providers of image recognition technology. It seemed we were on to something...</p>
										<p>We downloaded and analyzed each of these apps, analyzing the usability, testing the accuracy and breadth of the technology.</p>
										<p>Each had pros and cons that we featured into our design strategy.</p> 

										<h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
										<p>There was definitely a market for it. <a href="http://investor.slyce.it/" target="_blank">According to Slyce</a>, 90% of information transmitted to the brain is visual, and it’s processed 60,000 times faster than text.</p>
										<p><a href="http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/image-recognition.asp" target="_blank">According to Markets &amp; Markets</a>, <em>the image recognition market worth is estimated to grow from $9.65 billion 2014 to $25.65 billion by 2019.</em></p>

										<!-- <p><b>Macy’s Success Story</b><br>In 2014, Macy's announced the integration of visual search software within their mobile application. Macy's was later named 2014 Mobile Retailer of the Year, the highest accolade in mobile commerce and retail. http://careers.ulitzer.com/node/3270217#related</p> -->
										<h2>Tech Research</h2>
										<p><b>Who makes this tech?</b><br>We found Slyce and Cortexica to be the leading providers of image recognition technology. The image below shoes the retailers that have recently signed contracts with them.</p>

										<h2>User Flow</h2>
										<p>Before designing, we planned the user flow. We did this to avoid the mistake of forgetting something.  </p><br>

										<h2>Design Studio Sketching</h2>
										<p>We diverged into design studio sketching where we each sketched out our ideas individually for 5-10 minutes at a time to then converge and discuss our design point. It was a great way to design quickly as a team: sketch, discuss, iterate, approve, etc.</p><br><br>
